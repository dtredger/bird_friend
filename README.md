# Bird Friends

This repo contains code for a series of birds animated with microservos, LEDs and speakers. They were developed in numbered order, so "Crow Friend" is the most cobbled together, and they progressively get a bit better. Each specific project contains its own readme.

The original prototype (\#1 "Crow Friend") uses a full-size Raspberry Pi, but subsequent versions use Raspberry Pi nanos and MicroPython. \#3 "Edgar" includes a wifi module, but others do not.

Starting with \#5, functionality that could be shared was put into the `lib/` directory, so future versions should be able to import the modules in there. \#5 also includes a circuit diagram, so it should be easier to repeat in the future, as well as a list of parts required (in that specific project's readme).
